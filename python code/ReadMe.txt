The folder consist the MWU algorithm implementation.
The files are as follows:

1. MWU algorithm.py : the python implementation
2. MWU algorithm.ipynb : The same code in a ipython notebook format. This format is more friendly for exploring the code.
3. MWU vs NW.py : The implementation of the MWU algorithm along side the competetive Nadaraya-Watson.
4. MWU vs NW.ipynb : same as 2
5. MWU vs NW.html: an html presentation for how to use the code.

The python code depend on the following packages
using MWU: torch; pandas; numpy; 
comparison for other learner: sklearn;
plot: pyplotlib;
